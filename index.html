    <h3>Self Thoughts</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>we know others through  their actions we know ourselves through our thoughts</li>
        <li>Thoughts are powerful, when they are converted into actions. without actions,they are simply broken promises</li>
        <li>The social media and streaming platforms are designed in manner that hooks your attention
            <ul>
                <li>more you like the content.</li>
                <li>more they will recommend it.</li>
                <li>more watch time less sleep time.</li>
            </ul>
            disconnection helps, because motivation can,t especially if all the smartest minds of the world are 24*7 thinking on how to keep you glued.
            saying no to everything esle and sleeping on time is the greatst secret sause of self love.
